# Transition Animation System Setup Guide

## Overview
This system creates smooth 4-panel transition animations between different game states, starting with your initial animation and transitioning to your manually added sprites.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create TransitionAnimationSystem GameObject
1. **Create empty GameObject** called "TransitionSystem"
2. **Add the TransitionAnimationSystem script** to it

### Step 2: Set Up Your Multiple Variable-Length Animations
1. **Import your different animation sprites** into Unity
2. **In TransitionAnimationSystem Inspector**:
   - Set `transitionAnimations` array size to 5 (or however many different animations you have)
   - For each animation, set the sub-array size to however many panels that animation has:
     - **Animation 0**: Egg cracking sequence (4 panels)
     - **Animation 1**: Different transition for 100 clicks (could be 3, 5, 6 panels, etc.)
     - **Animation 2**: Different transition for 1,000 clicks (could be 2, 7, 8 panels, etc.)
     - **Animation 3**: Different transition for 10,000 clicks (any number of panels)
     - **Animation 4**: Different transition for 100,000 clicks (any number of panels)

### Step 3: Set Up Game State Sprites
1. **In TransitionAnimationSystem Inspector**:
   - Set `gameStateSprites` array size to 5 (or however many you have)
   - Drag your manually created sprites to the array:
     - Element 0: Sprite after first animation completes
     - Element 1: Sprite after 100 clicks (stability drops)
     - Element 2: Sprite after 1,000 clicks
     - Element 3: Sprite after 10,000 clicks
     - Element 4: Sprite after 100,000 clicks

### Step 4: Connect References
1. **In TransitionAnimationSystem Inspector**:
   - **Main Sprite Renderer**: Drag your MainSprite GameObject
   - **Stability System**: Drag your StabilitySystem GameObject

2. **In StabilitySystem Inspector**:
   - **Transition System**: Drag your TransitionSystem GameObject

### Step 5: Configure Settings
1. **Panel Duration**: Set to 0.5 seconds (or adjust as needed)
2. **Play On First Click**: Keep checked (true)

## How It Works

### Initial State:
- **Game starts**: Shows first panel of your 4-panel animation
- **First click**: Plays the full 4-panel animation (0.5s per panel)
- **After animation**: Stays on the last panel until 100 clicks

### Transition States:
- **At 100 clicks**: Plays 4-panel animation, then shows your first game state sprite
- **At 1,000 clicks**: Plays 4-panel animation, then shows your second game state sprite
- **At 10,000 clicks**: Plays 4-panel animation, then shows your third game state sprite
- **And so on...**

## Animation Flow:
```
Game Start → Animation 0, Panel 1 (static)
First Click → Animation 0: All panels (0.5s each) → Game State Sprite 0
100 Clicks → Animation 1: All panels (0.5s each) → Game State Sprite 1
1,000 Clicks → Animation 2: All panels (0.5s each) → Game State Sprite 2
10,000 Clicks → Animation 3: All panels (0.5s each) → Game State Sprite 3
```

**Note**: Each animation can have any number of panels (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc.)

## Customization Options:
- **Panel Duration**: Change how fast the animation plays
- **Animation Sprites**: Replace with your own variable-length sequences
- **Game State Sprites**: Add more sprites for additional transitions
- **Animation Length**: Each animation can have any number of panels
- **Trigger Conditions**: Modify when transitions occur

## Testing:
1. **Run the game**
2. **Should see first panel** of your animation
3. **Click once** - should play the 4-panel animation
4. **Click to 100** - should play animation again, then show your game state sprite
5. **Continue clicking** - should trigger more transitions

The system creates smooth, cinematic transitions between all your game states!
